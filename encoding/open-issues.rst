Open Issues
===========

* ShEx / SHACL generation on the basis of the UML model, would be great for validation
* Would following encodings make sense?

  * JSON Schema (issues with XSD-based generator), would be great for validation
  * GraphQL (tests with generateDS and StarUML should be documented)

* Pending tests with the various approaches
* Does the definition of a set of common high-lever functions (get, set, ...) make sense across various encodings?
* Review of UML Class Model Interoperable Subset (UCMIS)?
