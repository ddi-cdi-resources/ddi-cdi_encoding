/**
 * Definition
 *             ============
 *             Temporal constraints provide a mechanism for expressing concurrency control and synchronization
 *             
 *             Examples
 *             ==========
 *             Allen's Interval Algebra is a set of temporal constraints. So are the Split and SplitJoin ControlConstructs
 *             
 *             Explanatory notes
 *             ===================
 *             Allen's interval algebra is a calculus for temporal reasoning that was introduced in 1983. Reasoning with qualitative time in Allen's full interval algebra is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) complete. Research since 1995 identified maximal tractable subclasses of this algebra via exhaustive computer search and also other ad-hoc methods. In 2003, the full classification of complexity for satisfiability problems over constraints in Allen's interval algebra was established algebraically.
