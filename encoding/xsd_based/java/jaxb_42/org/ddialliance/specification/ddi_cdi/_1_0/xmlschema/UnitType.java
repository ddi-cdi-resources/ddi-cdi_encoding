/**
 * Definition
 *             ==========
 *             Unit type is a type or class of objects of interest (units).
 *             
 *             Examples
 *             ========
 *             Person, Establishment, Household, State, Country, Dog, Automobile, Neutrino.

 *             Explanatory notes
 *             =================
 *             Unit type is the most general in the hierarchy of unit type, universe, and population. It is a description of the basic characteristics for a general set of Units. A universe is a set of entities defined by a specialization of a unit type. A Population further narrows the specification to a specific time and geography.
 *             
 *             A unit type is used to describe a class or group of Units based on a single characteristic with no specification of time and geography. For example, the unit type of "Person" groups together a set of Units based on the characteristic that they are "Persons".
 *             
 *             It concerns not only unit types used in dissemination, but anywhere in the statistical process. E.g. using administrative data might involve the use of a fiscal unit. [GSIM 1.1].
